      <h4>
        Hey. <br />
        <br />
        I'm a father and creative person with an unusually broad career spanning
        publishing, technology and event management. <br />
        <br />I believe that with knowledge comes the responsibility to teach
        yourself whatever you're here to learn.
        <br />
        <br />
        I follow Stoic philosophy and escape to the quiet of open spaces.
        <br />
        <br />
        My music has been heard by millions.
        <br />
        <br />I gravitate towards companies that provide opportunities for
        upskilling. I hope to always remain curious, passionate and optimistic
        in overcoming life's challenges.
        <br />
        <br />
        Thanks for stopping by ðŸ™‚
        <br />
        <br />
