      <h4>
        Hey. <br />
        <br />
        I'm a father and creative person with an unusually broad career spanning
        web publishing, technology and event management. <br />
        <br />I gravitate towards companies that provide opportunities for
        upskilling. I hope to remain curious and passionate in my choice of
        work.
        <br />
        <br />I believe that knowledge acquisition comes bundled with the
        responsibility to teach others.
        <br />
        <br />
        I follow Stoic philosophy and escape to the quiet of open spaces.
        <br />
        <br />
        My music is freely available to fellow creators, and is enjoyed by
        millions.
        <br />
        <br />
        Thanks for stopping by ðŸ™‚
        <br />
        <br />
        John
