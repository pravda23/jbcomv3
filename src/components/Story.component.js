      <p>
        Hey!
        <br />
        <br />
        My name is John Bartmann. I'm a South African technical-creative person
        with an unusually broad career history. <br />
        <br />I love learning and gravitate towards opportunities for
        upskilling. I believe that knowledge acquisition comes bundled with the
        responsibility to teach others. I aim to remain curious and passionate
        in my choice of work.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm proud of my ability to solve problems for others, and of my music. I
        follow Stoic philosophy and regularly escape to the quiet of open spaces
        with my wife and son.
        <br />
        <br />
        Thanks for stopping by ðŸ™‚
        <br />
        <br />
        John
      </p>
